abstract: "Intensive wind shear phenomena, such as downbursts and gust fronts, pose a hazard to aviation, and issuing local forecasts of them could improve safety and decrease costs. In this thesis, a methodology for detecting and nowcasting wind shear using Doppler weather radar data is developed. The method consists of detecting the shear from one to three weather radars, representing them as objects, and tracking and extrapolating their trajectory for short-time forecasts from 5 to 15 minutes. The method is studied using a case study of a very intensive shear line generated by a thunderstorm in southern Finland on August 12, 2017. Using the synthesized wind field from three radars to detect shear performs poorly. Instead, the shear detected by different radars should be combined only as objects. The tracking and forecasting of the object trajectory is done with a discrete white noise acceleration model using a Kalman filter. The method shows potential for identifying the trajectories of the shear, but further studying of the used state variable for the shear location is required."
