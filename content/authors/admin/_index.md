I am a researcher in the [Radar Science](https://space.fmi.fi/main/remote-and-in-situ-observations-nowcasting-and-intelligent-traffic/) research group at the [Finnish Meteorological Institute](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/). My research focuses on short-term nowcasting of severe convective weather, especially wind gusts. In my research I use weather radar as well as Doppler lidar observations.
I am also involved in several research [projects](#projects) with international partners.

I started my PhD studies in 2020 at the [Doctoral Programme in Atmospheric Sciences](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/research/doctoral-education/doctoral-schools-and-programmes/doctoral-school-in-natural-sciences/doctoral-programme-in-atmospheric-sciences) in the University of Helsinki.
Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at LUT university in computational engineering, focusing in mathematical modelling, data analysis and physics.
During my Master's, I also spent the academic year 2017--2018 as an Erasmus student studying mathematics at Università degli studi di Milano in Milan, Italy.
